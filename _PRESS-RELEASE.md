# **Invoice FORMer** #

## *Effortlessly generate invoices using your small business' Google Forms order form* ##

<br>

Many small businesses build order forms in Google Forms that allow their customers to submit orders. The data all goes into a spreadsheet which is nice, but hardly useful without a bunch of extra work. Simply provide Invoice FORMer with the link to your Google Forms results spreadsheet and it will automatically generate and save invoices for each of your Google Form submissions.

Having to manually build invoices for orders using your Google Form results spreadsheet is time consuming, mundane, and prevents you from focusing fully on running your business.

After following a few guidelines to correctly format your Google Form order form, and linking your form results to Invoice FORMer, each of your form results will be turned into an Invoice that you can view, download, or print.
